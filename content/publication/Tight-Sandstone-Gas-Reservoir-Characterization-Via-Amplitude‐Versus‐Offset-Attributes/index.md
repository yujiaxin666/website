abstract: "The low porosity and low permeability of tight sandstone pose considerable challenges on characterizing the reservoir fluid. Moreover, the geophysical characteristics of the tight sandstone are usually similar to the surrounding rocks, leading to small impedance contrast, compounding the difficulty of reservoir parameters inversion. Amplitude‐versus‐offset technology is an important tool to invert the reservoir parameters from seismic data. The existing amplitude‐versus‐offset inversion methods are challenged to predict the tight sandstone reservoir parameters for the reasons above. In this paper, we propose a new workflow based on amplitude‐versus‐offset attributes to characterize the tight sandstone gas reservoirs in the Xihu Depression, East China Sea."
