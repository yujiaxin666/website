abstract: "we present rockphypy: a comprehensive and streamlined Python library that offers access to a vast array of rock physics models and workflows ranging from basic to sophisticated. The library is designed to be easily embedded in interdisciplinary fields such as deep neural networks and probabilistic frameworks, leveraging the rich resources of Python. Currently, rockphypy implements ten modules with over 100 methods, accessible through a straightforward and user-friendly API that facilitates various modeling tasks in rock physics. Its modular design allows easy extension to incorporate new features and functionalities. In addition to the versatility of the library, we have shown that rockphypy also greatly simplifies practical tasks that require many different rock physics models, enabling fast experimentation and iteration of research and practical programs. Check the documentation https://rockphypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html# for more information. "

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: rockphypy is a Python-based open-source library dedicated to rock physics modeling. It caters to individuals interested in rock physics and empowers them to apply rock physics tools in their work and research effectively.Built upon the foundations of Stanford SRB tools , rockphypy has successfully migrated and optimized a wide range of rock physics models from Stanford SRB Matlab tools to Python. Additionally, it extends the functionality by introducing new functions and practical workflows.
